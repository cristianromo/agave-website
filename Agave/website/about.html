                <h2>Why 'Agave?'</h2>
                <p>Agave is a succulent plant that is known for growing in the state of Jalisco, 
                    Mexico where my family is from. One notable use of agave, where most people know the plant from, 
                    is from tequila and blue agave syrup, a sweet substance similar to honey in nature. Keeping the name of 
                    agave in our family business helps my family and I continue to acknowledge it’s roots of our family’s heritage.</p>

            <h2> More Than a... <span> Real Estate Group</span></h2>
            <p>
                The land development segment’s activites include acquisition and development of land for residential purposes. The company currently controls 25 seperate real estate holdings throughout Northern California. Its current portfolio inclused 500 acres totaling 3,000 residential lots. <br>
                Agave operates as the construction arm of the company. Agave constructs a variety of homes for entry-level, move-up, and luxury homebuyers. The company also builds high-density residential properties, such as condominium and townhouse complexes. The company has a reputation as a builder of quality homes of superior value. Agave has an advantage in that it operates as its own general contractor. This allow us to maintain tight control <br> of scheduling and quality.
                Agave also has the advantage of managing its sale outs and other real estate transactions through its own real estate brokerage firm. As a result of its multiple roles as owner, developer, contractor, project manager, and realtor; the company is able to efficiently manage the development process from acquisition to house closing. <br> <br>
                Agave Real Estate Group is a specialty developer and homebuilder. Historically, the comapny has been an “in-fill” developer focusing on the midrange market of $600,000 to $2,000,000 range. Agave builds on average 75 homes a year and develops an average of 300 residential lots per year. As a homebuilder, what seperates Agave from its competition is its commitment to building a quality home with superior value. As such, Agave consistently incorporates high-end upgrades into its standard product, giving its homes the look and feel of a custom home. By including these finishes in its designs, the company offers the buyer a superior product with a more predictable cost. <br> <br> 
                In development of residential lots, Agave brings online lots that are in proven markets and in many cases are adjacent to successful developments. Each of Agave’s developments is in desirable, high-growth areas of the California housing market. The company intends to continue to target these high-growth areas, thereby increasing its production to 150 to 200 units of new construction and 500 residential lots per year
